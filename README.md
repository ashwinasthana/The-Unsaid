## About
The Unsaid is a platform where people can anonymously share messages they never sent to loved ones, friends, family members, or anyone significant in their lives. It's a space for emotional expression, healing, and connection through shared human experiences of unspoken words.

Users can search for messages by recipient names and submit their own unsaid messages anonymously. Each message becomes part of a collective story of human emotion and connection.

---

## Demo

**Main Platform:** [https://the-unsaid.vercel.app](https://the-unsaid.vercel.app)

**Admin Panel:** [https://the-unsaid.vercel.app/admin](https://the-unsaid.vercel.app/admin)

Try searching for common names like "Sarah", "John", or "Mom" to see existing messages.
